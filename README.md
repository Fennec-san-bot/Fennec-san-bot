## Maintainer

This account is used for a specific purposes used on GitHub and holds no real information associated with it. [TwinDragon](https://github.com/TwinDragon) maintains this repo and the [Fennec-san](https://discord.gg/XCMUykVTFE) Discord Bot, which you can ask about access for your server by finding him on Discord as **TwinShadow#0666**.

## Inviting The Bot

Fennec-san is a semi-public Discord bot. What does this mean? While people are allowed to invite her, but due to Discord's limitations on how many servers a regular Discord bot is allowed to be in (this is 100 maximum), and that verification requires forking over very personal information to Discord, Fennec-san remains an unverified bot.

However, if you are still interested, you may start by filling out her [Invite Form](https://forms.gle/mErFjrowhqJnHwWv7) and following the questionaire. Some exceptions can be made to have the bot in your server, but it all depends on a few factors. Just be sure that your DM's are open in the event you are not in the Support Server so that **TwinShadow#0666** can DM you the invite link. If it isn't, the email used on the form will be the sole, and only, form of communication for a one-time email for the link instead.

If you wish to get a faster response, please feel free to join the Support Server below and you can wait there. It is not required to stay in the server afterwards, but you are welcome to stay and chat if one would like.
